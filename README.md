# Mechanistic Interpretability Framework for LLM Sleeper Agent Detection

An open-source implementation of a lightweight, active-defense architecture designed to identify and intercept latent backdoor triggers within Large Language Models (LLMs) before output decoding begins. 

This repository provides the engineering modules required to map vector divergence across internal transformer residual stream hooks, optimize logistic linear classification probes, and execute runtime token containment routines.

## 🚀 Core Features
* **Zero-Latency Latent Interception:** Intercepts forward pass activations directly at layer $\ell=2$ to avoid generation-stage decoding overhead.
* **Non-Destructive Containment:** Neutralizes verified adversarial state transitions by zeroing out targeted residual tensor dimensions without modifying or fine-tuning underlying network weights.
* **Transparent Architecture Inspection:** Built on top of `TransformerLens` for clean extraction and caching of multi-dimensional internal representation matrices across all processing layers.

## 🛠️ System Architecture

Our active defense network operates across three concurrent pipelines:
1. **Parallel Activation Caching:** Evaluates contextual strings to capture baseline ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{clean}}$) and perturbed ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{triggered}}$) residual tensor profiles via the `run_with_cache` interface.
2. **Linear Probe Boundary Optimization:** Maximizes linear separability over high-dimensional internal arrays using custom single-layer logistic classifiers.
3. **Runtime Interception Hook:** Continuously computes an empirical anomaly score ($\alpha$). When $\alpha \geq \tau$ (operational safety threshold, default $\tau = 0.85$), an inline intervention zero-fills active tensor channels, enforcing a safe null state default before generation initializes.
